Seems nice. Need to find a fix to the API error. Supposedly just the git gateway but mine is setup and it still complains.

Could clone a template then replace everything with my config if I still can't get it working. Should add hints to all the meta data things to help me remember.

## This theme

Need to figure out stuff for this theme as well.

## alexjj.com

Would be nice to have this for my personal site as well. Nice to use this anywhere to upload stuff. Once I get df stories going then I'll have a better idea.

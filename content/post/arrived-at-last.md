It was early in the month of Slate when I arrived at Holdstake. The previous ruler had outstayed his welcome; fueled by power (possibly) and booze (likely).

Things looked fine, sure we'd all heard of the mysterious death that had been put down to 'thirst' but was this something far more sinister?  Anyway... '_best carry on I suppose_' was my first thought.

The fort was progressing well, a substantial amount of time being spent on fixing unbroken stockpiles which took many dwarves well into Malachite before we had it all sorted.  Still, better being safe than sorry with all these kobold thieves about.

## Armok bless you Alath

Our finest bone carver had been missing for weeks, locked in his craftsdwarf's workshop.  My suspicions were at best foul play; at worst another of our own struck down with what has become known here as 'The Stone-Thirst'.

I wielded the hammer myself convinced that the stench of miasma was in the air.  I threw it against the alder door which crumbled to dust; indicating that our carpenter needed a little more time in the workshop and a little less time larking about near the still.

Alarth... not dead but making the finishing touches to his finest creation, which no thanks to my barging in has one fewer arms than perhaps an exquisite throne should have...
